# Machine Learning Internship (Python)

This repository contains the work I completed during my **3-month Machine Learning Internship using Python**, conducted at **Internship Studio**.  
The internship helped me strengthen my foundations in **Python programming** and introduced me to key concepts of **Machine Learning** through hands-on coding projects.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned
- Python programming basics (data types, loops, functions, OOP concepts)
- Data handling and preprocessing using **NumPy** and **Pandas**
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Introduction to **Machine Learning algorithms**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Working with **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- Python practice scripts from the internship  
- Machine Learning mini-projects with code and datasets  
- Notes and reference material
